# Ts phaser bomb game

a uni project that I am turning into a game about espionage

## Hey, what's this?

This is a server x client multiplayer (websocket) bomberman clone game.

### Why the fork?
i thought it would be perfect as a basis for creating a game about negotiation 
and espionage.
### Okay, but how do i build it?

First, you will need `node` and `npm`, after that you just download
the project and run:
 * `npm install`
 * `npm run bootstrap`
 * `npm run start:fresh`

 After those, you can open the `localhost:5000` and enjoy your game :D
 
 ### Preview

### Sprites

All the sprites here are made by me, except the main char, 
which is from the phaser tutorial, i only added more frames to it
